from course description:
"

Writing unit tests can be difficult, time-consuming, and slow when you can't isolate the classes you want to test from the rest of the system. In this course, Mocking in .NET Core Unit Tests with Moq: Getting Started, you'll learn how to create mocks and use them as dependencies to the classes you want to test. First, you'll discover how to configure mocked methods and properties to return specific values. Next, you'll cover how to perform behavior/interaction testing. Finally, you'll explore how to setup mocked exceptions and events. When you're finished with this course, you'll have the necessary knowledge to use Moq to unit test your classes in isolation by creating and using mock objects.
